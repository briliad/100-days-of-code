# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Python by reading through "Automating the Boring Stuff with Python"

**Thoughts:** I basically copy-pasted code and tried to understand it.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created my first function in Python.

**Thoughts**: Python is straightforward to test. I'm kind liking not having to compile to test my code.
